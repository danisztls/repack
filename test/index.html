        <h1>Double florin</h1>

        <p>The following is an excerpt from <time>8 May 2022</time> featured article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_florin">Wikipedia</a>.

        <blockquote>
          <p>The <strong>double florin</strong>, or four-shilling piece, was a British coin produced by the Royal Mint between 1887 and 1890. One of the <strong>shortest-lived</strong> of all <strong>British coin</strong> denominations, it was struck in only four years. Its obverse, designed by Joseph Boehm and engraved by Leonard Charles Wyon, depicts <strong>Queen Victoria</strong>, whilst the reverse, featuring national symbols of the United Kingdom, was designed by Wyon based on the coinage of Charles II.</p>

          <p>The double florin was introduced as part of a <strong>coinage redesign</strong> that took place in <strong>1887</strong>, the year of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. One purpose of the redesign was to <strong>replace portraits of the queen</strong> which had changed little since her youth, and which no longer resembled the monarch, who was nearing her seventieth birthday. Mint officials and politicians also sought to <strong>reduce dependence on the half sovereign</strong>, a gold coin worth ten shillings which was expensive to strike, by issuing the double florin (four shillings) and reintroducing the crown (five shillings) coin. They may also have intended a further decimalisation of the coinage after the introduction of the florin (two shillings, or one-tenth of a pound) in 1849.</p>

          <p>When issued in <strong>June 1887</strong>, the Jubilee coinage provoked an <strong>outcry</strong>. The small royal crown Boehm had placed on Victoria's head caused <strong>widespread mockery.</strong> The double florin in particular was criticised as it was close in size to the five-shilling crown, leading to <strong>confusion</strong>, especially since neither coin was inscribed with its denomination. The confusion was said to be particularly acute in public houses, where barmaids accepted it believing it to be a crown, giving it the nickname of "Barmaid's Ruin" or "Barmaid's Grief". The coin was <strong>abolished after 1890</strong>, though it remained in circulation. Upon full decimalisation in 1971, the double florin was not demonetised, and remains legal tender for <strong>20p (£0.20)</strong>.</p>
